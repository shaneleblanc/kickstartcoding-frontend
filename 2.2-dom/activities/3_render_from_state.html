                    1. Do the first thing you do in JavaScript, e.g.
                    console.log.  Double check in Chrome you are seeing the
                    change appear.  Hint: To make work on activity easier, add
                    the line: console.log(state); here in render()

                    2. Once you confirm this is working, explain in your own
                    words with students next to you what a "template literal"
                    is, and where one appears in the code below, and what that

                    Hi Instructors, <br />

                    I will attending class remotely today. I have come down
                    with a case of "${ state.sillyNoun } syndrome" after
                    injesting a ${ state.noun } and have a
                    horribly ${ state.adjective } liver. We have made an
                    appointment with Dr. ${ state.familyName}, who is the
                    world's greatest expert on ${ state.sillyNoun } syndrome
                    and has ${ state.largeNumber } degrees in sciencing from
                    ${ state.country } University. Dr.  ${state.familyName} will
                    send you all the information you need.  Thank you!<br />
