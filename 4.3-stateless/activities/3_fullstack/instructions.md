Complete the movie catalog and search system, on your own!

For this challenge we won't give you any hints. The backend is written for you,
and a bit of code is given as a starter, but nothing interesting is yet is
displayed, and there is no way to add new movies.

Your goal is this:
    - Display all movies, with all the information we get about them, on the
      page by default
    - Make the search box functional, so that it "filters" the pages available
    - Add a form to the bottom that lets you add movies by using a POST request

To get this going:

    Run at top level in one terminal:
        python3 server.py
    Run in client/ in another terminal (or tab):
        npm start run   

Broad hints:

1. Think about previous activities. What sort of steps should you always take
first when approaching a new challenge?

2. What is a good, intermediate goal to set for yourself?

3. Think about applying each of the following tools:
    - Pseudocode
    - State-diagrams (VERY useful for React! It's why we learned them)
    - Component wireframe

4. There is a API server. Try visiting it with your browser. Poke at it. What
can you deduce? The code for it is very short, see if you can figure out the
routes that it is expecting, even though you have never coded using this
framework (bottle) before.

5. MOST IMPORTANTLY, start experimenting and writing code! Don't just stare at
it. Change something, experiment, and see what happens. Just be careful to not
change too much at once, and always have your finger on the "undo" button :)
