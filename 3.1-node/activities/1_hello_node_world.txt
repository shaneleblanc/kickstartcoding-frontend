This activity is to ensure you have Node installed, set up, and
understand how to create and run JavaScript files using Node.js


------------------------------------
Challenge 1
Ensure you have node installed by running the following command:

    node --version

If you get "command not found", you can install it with:

    Ubuntu Linux:
        sudo apt-get install nodejs
    macOS:
        brew install node

NOW, make sure you can do some basic math with node. Run:

    node

to enter an interactive prompt. Type

    console.log("Hello world!")           <hit enter>
    3 + 5                                 <hit enter>

to see JavaScript working!

IMPORTANT: Use Ctrl+D to exit. Whenever you see the "> " that means you
are in a node prompt, NOT a Bash prompt. Just like the Python ">>> "
prompt, the only use of this is for immediately running code snippets,
or use like a calculator. It is not useful for typical development.


------------------------------------
Challenge 2

With your text editor, save a new file called "helloworld.js" in some
directory. Give the file a console.log saying "Hello Node World!".  With
a terminal, go to that directory, and run it using:

    node helloworld.js


------------------------------------
Challenge 3

Node.js has a slightly different flavor of JavaScript than the browser.
It does NOT have access to "window" or "document" (because there is no
DOM). It DOES have access to a global variable called "process", along
with a function called "require". This variable has various information
about the operating system, the file being executed, along with a lot of
not very useful stuff. By using console.log(process), can you
console.log out in your helloworld.js the following information?

1. The version of node that is running.
2. The name that node calls your operating system (hint: look for "platform")
3. An array containing the command-line arguments used with node.

HINT: For Linux, should be something like:
['/usr/bin/node', '/home/your_username/projects/helloworld.js']
For macOS, it should be similar, except the /usr/bin/node will probably
be replaced with a longer path set by homebrew (will differ depending on
version), and /home/ will be /Users/.



------------------------------------
Bonus Challenge:

Write code that loops through the environmental variables, printing the
name and value of each one.
