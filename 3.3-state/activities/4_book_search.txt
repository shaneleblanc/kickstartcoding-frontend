Your challenge is to build a book searching application, from scratch!

See the working application here:
http://vast-retreat-72383.herokuapp.com/

General tips:

* Start with a previous activity

* Play around with the Open Library API.  Hint:
  http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=lord+of+the+rings&limit=10&offset=0

* Research their cover API. Hint:
  http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8069767-M.jpg -- the number can be
  replaced by an ID from the object you get back from their API.
